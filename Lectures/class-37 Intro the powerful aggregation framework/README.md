## üìå What is Aggregation?

Aggregation is the process of transforming, summarizing, and analyzing data. In
MongoDB, the Aggregation Framework allows you to process data records and return
computed results ‚Äî similar to SQL‚Äôs `GROUP BY`, `SUM`, `JOIN`, and `AVG`.

## üß† Why is it Powerful?

MongoDB‚Äôs Aggregation Framework is powerful because:

- It works like a pipeline, processing data through multiple transformation
  stages.

- It can filter, group, sort, reshape, and analyze data efficiently.

- It reduces the need for additional processing in your application code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Aggregation Stages

| Stage      | Description                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `$match`   | Filters documents (like WHERE in SQL)           |
| `$group`   | Groups documents and performs operations        |
| `$sort`    | Sorts the documents                             |
| `$project` | Selects specific fields and reshapes the output |
| `$limit`   | Limits the number of documents returned         |
| `$count`   | Counts the number of documents                  |

## Syntax

```js
db.collection.aggregate([
  // Stage 1
  {
    /* operation */
  },

  // Stage 2
  {
    /* operation */
  },

  // Stage 3
  {
    /* operation */
  },
]);
```

### Example

Suppose we have a `cousins` collection. The goal is to:

1. Exclude cousins who have an exam
2. Include only those with a budget of 500 or more
3. Sort them by age (descending)
4. Calculate the total budget and list their names

```js
db.cousins.aggregate([
  // Filter out cousins who have exams
  {
    $match: { hasExam: { $ne: true } },
  },
  // Filter out cousins with budget less than 500
  {
    $match: { budget: { $gte: 500 } },
  },
  // Sort by age in descending order
  {
    $sort: { age: -1 },
  },
  // Group to calculate total budget and collect names
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      totalBudget: { $sum: '$budget' },
      cousins: { $push: '$name' },
    },
  },
]);
```

## üìä When to Use Aggregation Framework

- Generating reports

- Creating dashboards

- Performing statistical analysis

- Reshaping or transforming large datasets
